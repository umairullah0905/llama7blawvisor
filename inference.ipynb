The main reason for this prediction is that the Court of Appeal in Edwards v. Roberts (1935) 19 Tax Cas 618, construed a similar scheme and came to the contrary conclusion. The learned Judges in the present case distinguished the case of Channel, J., in (1904) 5 Tax Cas 36, on the ground that under the scheme, the sums taxed were really an addition to the salary of the Assistant Master, and therefore, not taxable. The principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Edwards v. Roberts, namely, that unless a vested interest in the sum accrues to an employee, it is not taxable, equally applies to the present case. As no vested interest in the sum contributed by the employer under the scheme vested in the employee, it is not a perquisite allowed to him by the employer or an amount due to him from the employer within the meaning of S. 7 (1) of the Act. Therefore, the High Court is likely to reject the appeal/petition.\n"

Unproven charges: The labour court held that two of the three charges framed against the employee, including altering and over-writing the entries in the leave register with respect to other employees, and neglect in keeping in safe custody the leave register of 1956, had not been proved.\n",

The claims relate to the loss allegedly sustained by the appellant-plaintiff subsequent to the compromise, which falls outside the ambit of the agreement.\n",
      "3. The respondent has raised pleas of fraud in challenging the compromise decree, which could only be decided by the Civil Court upon consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties. Since the merits of such a plea could only be decided by the Civil Court, it is appropriate that the appeal/petition be accepted.\n",
      "4. The case proceeding also highlights that there is no arbitration clause relating to the dispute between the parties in not appointing the appellant as stockist and the claim of compensation towards loss of goodwill and reputation. This further supports the conclusion that the appeal/petition should be accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the provided case proceeding, I predict that the appeal/petition will be accepted (1) as the dispute does not fall within the ambit of the agreement dated 01.05.1997 and the High Court erred in referring the dispute to arbitration.\n"
